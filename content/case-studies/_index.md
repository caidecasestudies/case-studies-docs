title: Case Studies

Each case study has the same format, with the same header materials, that list the different themes for the scenario, the authors of the study, any prerequisites for the study (such as coding experience in python or legal knowledge), how to cite the study in your own work, links to the Github repository and pdf version, and instructions for use.

## Themes

We've divided the landscape of ethical issues into several themes, and we tag each case study with at least one of these themes. The themes we have are:  

- Algorithmic Bias & Fairness  
- Transparency  

## Prerequisite

There are no prerequisites for using the initial scenario and discussion questions of each case study. But, for those studies that are expanded with technical material, we list what prerequisites might be helpful for completing those sections.
